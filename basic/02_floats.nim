#[ floats for example 2.73, -3.14, 5.0 and 4e7 (which means
4 * 10^7). you can use the four math operations '+ - * /' but
div and mod aren't defined.

also the normal math precedence operations is as one would expect.
then it would be 'point before line' (some german saying i know).
echo 2 + 3 * 4 would be 14.

some sidenotes here: tab's are not supported, so use spaces!]#

let
  c = 6.75
  d = 2.25

echo "c + d = ", c + d  # = 9.0
echo "c - d = ", c - d  # = 4.5
echo "c * d = ", c * d  # = 15.1875
echo "c / d = ", c / d  # = 3.0
